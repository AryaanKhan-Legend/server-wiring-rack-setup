Overview: This project demonstrates the process of configuring, organizing, and wiring a server rack to improve network reliability and maintenance efficiency. It focuses on structured cabling, labeling, and standard server setup practices.

What I Did:

Configured and connected servers, switches, and patch panels (using personal lab equipment or sanitized examples).
Implemented structured cabling and labeling to improve clarity and reduce setup time.
Documented rack layout and device organization for easier maintenance.
Gained hands-on experience with rack-mounted servers, UPS systems, and networking equipment.

Skills Demonstrated:
Rack and server setup
Networking basics (LAN/WAN, ports, IPs)
Documentation and IT asset organization
Troubleshooting and system reliability improvements

Indepth Overview:

My Labeling Method: 
Blue: Network connections (LAN)
Yellow: Power connections or PDU lines
Red: Critical servers or high-priority connections
Green: Auxiliary connections, test/dev devices
White/Gray: General purpose or patch cables

Each cable has a printed label at both ends showing the source and destination (e.g., Switch 1 â†’ Server 3).
Labels are consistent across the rack to make tracing connections fast and reduce mistakes.
Patch panels and switches also have corresponding numbers/ports clearly documented.

Benefits:
Quickly identify and trace connections without unplugging devices.
Reduces downtime during maintenance or upgrades.
Helps new team members understand the setup without needing verbal instructions.

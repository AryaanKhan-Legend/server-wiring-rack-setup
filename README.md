## 🔍 In-Depth Overview

### 🎨 My Labeling Method
| Color | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 🔵 Blue | Network connections (LAN) |
| 🟡 Yellow | Power connections / PDU lines |
| 🔴 Red | Critical servers / high-priority connections |
| 🟢 Green | Auxiliary connections / test/dev devices |
| ⚪ White / Gray | General purpose / patch cables |

- Each cable has a **printed label** at both ends showing the source and destination (e.g., `Switch 1 → Server 3`).  
- Labels are **consistent across the rack** for quick tracing and reduced mistakes.  
- Patch panels and switches also have **matching port numbers** clearly documented.

### ✅ Benefits
- 🔎 Quickly identify and trace connections without unplugging devices.  
- ⏱️ Reduces downtime during maintenance or upgrades.  
- 👥 Helps new team members understand the setup without verbal guidance.
